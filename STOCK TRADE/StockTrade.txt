Java Practice Programming

1.) Read StockTrade from a txt FILE
    write a small java program that will read a txt file and convert it into the StockTrade object and does some analysis on it

   -txt File will have following fields
	
	(Security:String,

	Date:util.Date,

	Open:Double,
	
	High:Double,	
	
	Low:Double,
	
	Close:Double,

	Volume:Double,
	
	Adj Close:Double)

   -create a Java class StockTrade(Domain Object) that will hold the value of one Stock Trade
   
   
   IStockTradeReader
    //reads the trade from CSV file convert it into StockTrade Object and return it as List
	public List<StockTrade> readStockTrades() throws StockTradeInValidFormatException

	//Find the Stock trade out of the List that has max volume
	public StockTrade getMaxVolumeTrade(List<StockTrade>)

	//Find the Stock trade out of the List that has min volume
	public StockTrade getMinVolumeTrade(List<StockTrade>)

	//Return the difference of open vs High that is high-open with Date being the Key and value being the difference
	public Map<Date,Double> getDailyTradingDifferential(List<StockTrade>)

   
  StockTradeReaderImpl implements IStockTradeReader {
   //The following private methods are advised to read and transform the Line in CSV

   private StockTrade parseStockCSVLine(String csLine)
   //you are open to add other private methods
   }
